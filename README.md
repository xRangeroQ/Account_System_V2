# Account_System_V2

## 📌 Purpose
This project demonstrates a **basic account management system** implemented in C++.  
It is designed to handle user registration, login, and account validation.  
The goal is to provide a simple example for learning how to build authentication systems in console applications.

---

## 🧐 What Does It Do?
- Allows users to **create accounts** with a username and password.
- Supports **login functionality** to validate user credentials.
- Provides a simple **account storage mechanism** (e.g., text file or in-memory).
- Can be extended into more advanced authentication systems.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program starts and presents a menu (e.g., Register, Login, Exit).
2. Users can register by entering a username and password.
3. Credentials are stored securely (basic implementation).
4. Users can log in with their credentials.
5. The system validates input and grants or denies access.
